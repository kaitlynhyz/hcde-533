    <p>When I heard that we had the option to either use the CNC Mill or 3D printer, I immediately gravitated towards 3D printing as I thought it would be more convenient and a lot easier to do... I was wrong. Creating a box was harder than I expected.

    <p>Working in Rhino, I designed a few test pieces. Originally, I wanted my box to be tiny.
