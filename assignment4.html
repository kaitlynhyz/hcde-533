            <h3>Assembly</h3>

    <p>Assembling my Ender printer took almost a week due to procrastination. I was able to build out most of it in ~3 hrs. The instructions included in the box included pictures but it was quite hard to visually understand and interpret.
      I watched videos on YouTube for further explanation on how to properly assemble the parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQ0q9zLygTY">The Ultimate Creality Ender 3 Quick Start Guide</a> was the easiest and best video to follow!

    <p>Assembling wasn't that bad when following the videos. The most frustrating part was leveling the bed. It took me 2 days and some sleep to get things somewhat leveled out.
      I leveled the bed a dozen of times and ran multiple bed leveling protocols from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3235018">Filament Friday</a>. 
      I figured that the bed wasn't the issue... it was the Z-axis. The right side of the Z-axis seems to be wiggly and tend to drag along with the left side of the Z-axis. 
      I had to disassemble the parts and made sure the knobs were secured tightly. I had to download a leveler app to confirm that the bed was leveled properly.
      After countless hours of trying to figure out what went wrong, it all FINALLY came together!

<h3>Designing & Printing</h3>
<p>In the last couple of days, the only places I traveled between was within Rhino and Cura. I would design in Rhino and export the file to Cura. Most of the print settings were located in Cura. As someone who has never used that software before, I thought the print settings were really easy to navigate through.</p>

<p>When printing cubes, I had issues with adhesion. I changed the bed temperature from 50F to 80F and the print speed from 50mm/s to 30mm/s. Additionally, I used a BRIM for build plat adhesion. It was so satisfying to be able to peel it off from the cubes after it's finished printing.</p>

<p>Just when I got the hang out printing, I've encountered multiple spaghetti monster incidents. When printing cylinders, they didn't want to stick to the bed even when it was super hot. I had to print the cylinders a couple of times and pay close attention to them. </p>

<p>I liked the idea of creating multiple stars so I went with the idea and designed it in Rhino. After printing and assembling the nest items was when I realized that the stars ressembled a snowflake, especially when the filament is white - I'm not mad about the result!</p>
