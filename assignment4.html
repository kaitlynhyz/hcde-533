    <p>This assignment was extremely difficult than how I imagined it to be... I mean how hard can it be to make a box. I was truly humbled. When I heard that we had the option to either use the CNC Mill or 3D printer, I immediately gravitated towards 3D printing as I thought it would be more convenient and a lot easier to do.

    <p>Working in Rhino, I designed a few test pieces. Originally, I wanted my box to be tiny, but here are all the failed pieces.

    <p>I decided to redesign the box to reduce the number of box joints since it was getting way too complicated.</p>

    <p>Since my printer had issues with the box joints, I decided to make the boxes bigger. I went with a 60mm box.</p>

    <p>To my surprise, it fits! But I have to adjust the extrusion distance as it was a bit too thick.</p>

    <p>I went back to Rhino to make adjustments such as making the extrusion much smaller and adding a smooth side to the top of the box.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Unfortunately I had a lot of trouble creating the bottom of the box. After many attempts, I was not able to get it to fit with the measurements. I think that my printer has issues with its calibration :(</p>
