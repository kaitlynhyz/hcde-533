            <p>
                Here's my finished and assembled Parametric Laser Cut Construction:

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>I wanted to continue the polygon trend with my second project. </p>

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>Once I had settled on the design, I recreated it in Rhino. Before modeling, I measured the cardboard with a caliper which came out to be 3.18mm. I used this measurement to design the gaps for the shape.</p>

<p>These are the shapes that I ended up with: an octogan and square.</p>

<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>I headed to the 8 to do the laser cutting. I followed the written instructions on the board, but had issues bringing the laser cutter bed up to the laser. I asked the staff for help. The issue was that the stroke I set was too thich (1pt) when it was supposed to be 0.01pt. After that issue has been resolved, I was able to get the hang of laser cutting.
Additionally, the laser wouldn't fully cut through. The staff advised that I bump up the power which was really helpful!</p>

<p>I experimented with the size of the shapes to see which size I liked and to see if they would fit.</p>

<p>Laser cutter settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speed: 100</li>
    <li>Power: 80</li>
    <li>PPI: 300</li>
</ul>
