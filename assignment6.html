    <h2>Lamp!</h2>
    <h3>Part 1<h3>
    <p>I had a lot of ideas when it came to lamps. Ultimately, I wanted to do something that involved geometric shapes and played with shadow. I created a moodboard of what I liked. 
        I really liked the <b>top left design</b>; it reminded me of the Chinese lanterns â€“ so I decided to recreate that for this lamp assignment.

    <br>
    <p>I measured the diameter of the lamp innard in order to design the top piece of my lamp. </p>

    <br>
    <p>Then I got to work in Rhino. I designed a top piece where the lamp innard would be inserted and then the side pieces. I'm still deciding if I want to 3D print this or laser cut. However, due to convenience, I decided to do a test print on the 3D printer.</p>

    <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p>I continued to print the different pieces of the lamp.</p>
      <p>The next big thing is to think about how I would attach all the pieces together.<p>
