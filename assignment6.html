    <h2>Designing the Meta-Mold!</h2>
    <p>Last week, I was a bit ambitious and decided to mold a vase. I attended Junchao's office hour where he was able to show me a much easier approach to create a two-sided mold. I got everything down, but realized that I was doing the complete opposite approach of the meta-mold.</p>

    <br>
    <p>I lost my last few braincells trying to figure out how to solve my problem and ultimately decided to give up on the vase. I decided to do something much easier: <b>a sphere</b> (I should've listened to Nadya in the first place lol - she's never wrong)</p>
    <p>The Rhino workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create shape (if it's a mesh, change it to a polysurface with <code>meshtoNURB</code></li>
        <li>Use <code>boundingbox</code> to cover the shape</li>
        <li><code>ScaleID</code> to cover half of the shape and then <code>Mirror</code></li>
        <li>Add smaller spheres to the corners to make the keys. Add cylinders for the pouring vent and spruce</li>
        <li>Use <code>BooleanDifference</code> to take parts away. Can also use <code>Trim</code> to trim excess parts</li>
        <li>Use <code>DupBorder</code> and <code>Offset</code> to create the walls to extrude</li>
        <li>Once everything is created, use <code>BooleanUnion</code> to join shapes together</li>
    </ol>

    <p>After a couple hours of designing and iterating, I was able to 3D print them. Each mold took about 3 hrs to print (total 6 hrs).</p>

    <h2>Molding!</h2>
      <p>It's finally time to bring out the oomoo that has been sitting in my room for weeks! The instructions were pretty straightforward and easy to follow. Pour equal parts of both mixture and combine it together.</p>

<h2>Casting!</h2>
    <p>I used the low poly vases from Thingiverse when doing my mesh assignment. I decided to use one of the vases for my mold. I imported the stl into Rhino and split it in half.</p>

    <p>I worked on one side of the mold by adding the keys using truncated cones and half a cylinder for the pouring gate.</p>

    <p>While designing the molds in Rhino, I had a lot of trouble aligning both sides accurately. I attended Junchao's office hours and he demonstrated a different approach to creating the molds.</p>

Thank you Junchao for guiding me on a different approach on how to efficiently and effectively create the molds in Rhino!
