    <h2>Lamp!</h2>
    <p>Here's a quick preview of the lamp:</p>

    <h3>Part 1<h3>
        <h4>A recap of what went down last week:</h4>
    <p>I created a moodboard of the type of lamps that I would want to recreate. Ultimately, I decided to recreate the <b>top left design</b>.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>I did all my designs in Rhino where I created the top and side pieces.</p>

    <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p>After printing the top piece, I iterated the diameter of the top piece a couple of times so it was wide enough to fit the innard (not pictured). Additionally, I played around with the extrusion level to get a feel of how thick the walls should be. 
        Ultimately, I decided to go with an extrustion of 2.5mm; not very thin, but also thick enough to hold its shape. Since the sides were big, I printed each on individually which took 2hrs and 30mins each.</p>

<br>
    <p>Once all the pieces were printed, it was time to assemble. I originally tried using super glue but found that it was hard to stick due to the plastic material and that fact that my pieces were a thin to hold itself up. The next best option was using a hot glue gun â€“ that was truly a lifesaver!</p>

<p>Here's the bottom of the lamp looking upwards. Assembling it into the innard and adding a light bulb in was a breeze.</p>

<h2>Molding & Casting!</h2>
    <p>I used the low poly vases from Thingiverse when doing my mesh assignment. I decided to use one of the vases for my mold. I imported the stl into Rhino and split it in half.</p>

    <p>I worked on one side of the mold by adding the keys using truncated cones and half a cylinder for the pouring gate.</p>

    <p>While designing the molds in Rhino, I had a lot of trouble aligning both sides accurately. I attended Junchao's office hours and he demonstrated a different approach to creating the molds.</p>

<h3>Next steps:</h3>
<p>I plan to use the boundingbox approach to create the molds. Add the pouring vent and spruces. Test print. Start to use oomoo and ensure that there's enough time to cure. </p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
Thank you Junchao for guiding me on a different approach on how to efficiently and effectively create the molds in Rhino!
