    <h2>Mesh!</h2>
    <p>This assignment was extremely difficult than how I imagined it to be... I mean how hard can it be to make a box. I was truly humbled. When I heard that we had the option to either use the CNC Mill or 3D printer, I immediately gravitated towards 3D printing as I thought it would be more convenient and a lot easier to do.

    <h2>Lamp! (Part 1)</h2>

    <p>Working in Rhino, I designed a few test pieces. Originally, I wanted my box to be tiny, but here are all the failed pieces.
