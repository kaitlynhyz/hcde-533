            <p>
                Here's my finished and assembled Press Fit Kit:

                <h3>Assignment Requirements:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Kit consisting of at least 30 instances</li>
                    <li>At least one unique part</li>
                    <li>Parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit</li>
                    <li>Parts must be laser cut out on cardboard</li>
                    <li>Parts should fit and not come apart with a light shake test</li>
                 </ul>
            
    <h3>Ideation</h3>
            </p>    
            <p>Since I don't have any experience with laser cutting, this assignment was a bit intimidating and overwhelming. I decided to make my life easy and create simple shapes for the assignment
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>I started by sketching shapes that I would like to use and made a paper prototype using a dessert box. I had to adjust the size of the prototype so the shapes aren't overlapping each other when fitted</p>

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>Once I had settled on the design, I recreated it in Rhino. Before modeling, I measured the cardboard with a caliper which came out to be 3.18mm. I used this measurement to design the gaps for the shape.</p>

<p>These are the shapes that I ended up with: an octogan and square.</p>

<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>I headed to the 8 to do the laser cutting. I followed the written instructions on the board, but had issues bringing the laser cutter bed up to the laser. I asked the staff for help. The issue was that the stroke I set was too thich (1pt) when it was supposed to be 0.01pt. After that issue has been resolved, I was able to get the hang of laser cutting.
Additionally, the laser wouldn't fully cut through. The staff advised that I bump up the power which was really helpful!</p>

<p>I experimented with the size of the shapes to see which size I liked and to see if they would fit.</p>

<p>Here are the settings that I used on the laser cutter:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speed: 55</li>
    <li>Power: 75</li>
    <li>PPI: 300</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Thanks!</h3>
<p>Belinda for giving me a quick rundown on how to use the laser cutter machine. As well as the staff at the 8 for troubleshooting minor issues when laser cutting.</p>
