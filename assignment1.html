                Requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li> Kit consisting of at least 30 instances</li>
                    <li>At least one unique part</li>
                    <li>Parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit</li
                    <li>Parts must be laser cut out on cardboard</li>
                    <li>Parts should fit and not come apart with a light shake test</li>
                 </ul>
                 
            </p>    
            <p>
            Since I don't have any experience with laser cutting, this assignment was a bit intimidating and overwhelming. I decided to make my life easy and create simple shapes for the assignment.
