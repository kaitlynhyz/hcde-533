            <p>
                Requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li> Kit consisting of at least 30 instances</li>
                    <li>At least one unique part</li>
                    <li>Parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit</li>
                    <li>Parts must be laser cut out on cardboard</li>
                    <li>Parts should fit and not come apart with a light shake test</li>
                 </ul>
                 
            </p>    
            <p>Since I don't have any experience with laser cutting, this assignment was a bit intimidating and overwhelming. I decided to make my life easy and create simple shapes for the assignment
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>I started by sketching shapes that I would like to use and made a paper prototype using a dessert box.</p>
<p>Once I had settled on the design, I recreated it in Rhino</p>

<p>On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:
    <ul>
        <li><b>speed 40</b></li>
        <li><b>power 100</b></li>
        <li><b>freq 50</b></li>
    </ul>
</p>
