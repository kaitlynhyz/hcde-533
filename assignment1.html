            <p>
                Here's my finished and assembled Press Fit Kit:

                <h3>Assignment Requirements:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Kit consisting of at least 30 instances</li>
                    <li>At least one unique part</li>
                    <li>Parts must have slots that press fit into the other parts in the kit</li>
                    <li>Parts must be laser cut out on cardboard</li>
                    <li>Parts should fit and not come apart with a light shake test</li>
                 </ul>
            
    <h3>Ideation</h3>
            </p>    
            <p>Since I don't have any experience with laser cutting, this assignment was a bit intimidating and overwhelming. I decided to make my life easy and create simple shapes for the assignment
            </p>
<p>

            </p>
            <p>I started by sketching shapes that I would like to use and made a paper prototype using a dessert box. I had to adjust the size of the prototype so the shapes aren't overlapping each other when fitted</p>

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>Once I had settled on the design, I recreated it in Rhino</p>

<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
<p>Due to technical difficulties for the laser machines, I have not done the implementation part of the assignment. More information about my experience with laser cutting will be updated! </p>
