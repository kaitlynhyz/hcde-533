            <h1>A8: Final Project!</h1>
            Dec. 6, 2022
           <br>
   
    <p>For the final project, I designed a planter and plant stand.</p>

    <h2>Breakdown of Tasks / Techniques Used</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Incorporating / designing around <b>stock part</b></li>
        <li>3D Modeling in <b>Rhino</b></li>
        <li><b>Laser cutting</b> the plant stand</li>
        <li><b>Press fit</b> plant stand</li>
        <li><b>3D printing</b> planter</li>
        <li><b>Grasshopper</b> for parametric planter design <i>(stretch goal)</i></li> 
    </ol>

    <h2>Designing the Plant Stand</h2>
    <p>I researched styles of the plant stand that I wanted to design. I took a lot of inspiration from Etsy. Upon browsing Etsy, I found this plant stand.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Here are the measurements of the parts and a rendered version of what it should look like once I laser cut and assemble.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Laser Cutting</h2>
    <p>I exported the Rhino file as an .ai file and imported it into Adobe Illustrator. My birch hardwood was 24" x 24" which <i>barely</i> fit into the laser cutter machine. (Shoutout to the Lowe's employee for cutting my hardwood in half!). Since I only had 3 pieces to cut out, it was pretty easy to arrange them on the laser cutting layout in Illustrator.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>I had to adjust the size of the circle a couple of times to make it fit into the plant stand. Once I was able to get the right size, it was a snug fit!</p>
    <p>On the laser cutter, I used the following settings:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Speed:</b> 5</li>
            <li><b>Power:</b> 100</li>
            <li><b>PPI:</b> 300</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br>
    

    <h2>Designing the Planter</h2>
    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
    <p>I imported the .stl file into Cura to 3D print. I decided to print in <b>low quality</b> since I am impatient. I used the <b>Spiralize Outer Contour</b> mode; I learned that this is alternatively called "Vase Mode". The printing process was fairly quick: ~2 hours.</p>

    <br>
    <p>After a couple of hours of printing, it was ready! Here's what it looked like fresh out of the printer.</p>

    <h2>Assembly</h2>
    <p>I didn't like the light plywood, so I bought a walnut color wood stain off Amazon to paint over.</p>
    <img src="a8_paint.png" width=800></a>
    <br>
    <p>I transferred the plant from its nursery pot to the pot that I created.</p>

    <p>Here's a picture of the final product sitting with other plants that I have collected!</p>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>Thank you to the Lowes worker for cutting the plywood down so it could fit in the laser cutting machine. 
    <br>The couple of undergrads who were working on their airplane project at the 8... they helped me troubleshoot why the machine wouldn't start cutting :'^)
<br>The Discord Q&A and MILL status channels!</p>
